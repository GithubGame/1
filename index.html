<h1><a id="Automatic_PR_merging_Where_shall_we_go_0"></a>Automatic PR merging.<br/>Where shall we go?</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first Github Game repository: <a href="https://github.com/GithubGame/1">github.com/GithubGame/1</a></p>
<p>This is an experiment to see what will be produced when enough hackers collaborate together with no predetermined goal.</p>
<h2><a id="Pull_requests_made_to_this_repository_will_be_automatically_merged_according_to_the_rules_6"></a>Pull requests made to this repository will be automatically merged, according to the rules.</h2>
<p>Every time there is activity on a pull request, the rules will be checked to decide whether it will be merged. When there is enough activity on the repository, collaborators need to vote on PRs for them to be merged. Voting is done by using <a href="https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments">reactions</a>.</p>
<p>PR will be merged if:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are less than 10 collaborators in the last month</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>10% of committers in the last week cast a positive vote</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>30% of committers in the last month cast a positive vote</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules are managed in the <a href="https://github.com/GithubGame/rules">GithubGame/rules repository</a> and accepts PRs too, although not automatically.</p>
<h2><a id="Where_shall_we_go_24"></a>Where shall we go?</h2>
<p>If you want to submit a PR, please stick to these guidelines (protip - these guidelines apply to everyday life too):</p>
<ul>
<li>Be delightful (no hate).</li>
<li>Keep everything legal.</li>
<li>Avoid violence.</li>
<li>Don’t threaten or harass anyone.</li>
<li>Keep personal or confidential information personal and confidential.</li>
<li>Be yourself (no impersonations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go on a digital journey together. Where shall we go? That’s up to you.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make music or art together through software.</li>
<li>Apply machine learning to public information to make the world better in some way.</li>
<li>Something involving live video and kittens.</li>
<li>Use phone sensors to draw your walks on a worldwide canvas together.</li>
<li>Control physical hardware somewhere via a web control panel.</li>
</ul>

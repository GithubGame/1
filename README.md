# Automatic PR merging. Where shall we go?

Welcome to the first Github Game repository.

This is an experiment to see what will be produced when enough hackers collaborate together with no predetermined goal.

## Pull requests made to this repository will be automatically merged, according to the rules.

Every few minutes, the Github Game Master bot will check each pull request on this repository and decide whether to merge it. When there is enough activity on the repository, collaborators need to vote on PRs for them to be merged. Voting is done by using [reactions](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

PR will be merged if:

+ There are less than 10 collaborators in the last month

or

+ 10% of committers in the last week cast a positive vote

or 

+ 30% of committers in the last month cast a positive vote

Rules are managed in the [GithubGame/rules repository](https://github.com/GithubGame/rules) and accepts PRs too, although not automatically.

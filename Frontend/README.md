# Multi-lingual Assimilation Exchange (Max)

###The big idea
MultiLingual Assimilation Exchange or Max for short is technically just a lightweight chat client. The difference between 
Max and other chat clients is that Max for people learning a new language who want to speak that new language to a native 
speaker. 

The real driving force behind Max is it's community. You see when you join the Max community you agree to use Max in a
certain way; you agree to speak in the language that you aren't fluent in and want to work on. The person on the other 
end of the chat line will have made the same promise about the conversation you'll have. 

But here's the kicker, the person you'll be conversing with will be a native speaker of the language you're trying to learn
and they will be a student of your native tongue. The idea is that you both try and converse with each other in the 
languages you're learning and correct each other on the language that is native to you.
 
In this way you both will be able to learn far more natural expressions rather than just formally asking if your cat
could please have milk.

There will obviously also need to be an element where you can tell the app your proficiency with a language. you don't
want two newbies paired up with each other if you can avoid it. Ideally newbies will be paired with advance speakers
and as you get closer to intermediate level you start getting paired with intermediates until you've gone full circle
and become a pro youself ready to give back to the community.

###What's in the box?!
What I have checked in here is not really anything more than an idea. I've rolled an extremely simple and hashed
together UI in React to better give the idea. It's build pipeline is based on a create-react-app build so you
you can checkout the commands available to you in at [https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app]

To get everything running just pull down the repo and in the root of the Frontend project run the following commands:

``npm install``

``npm start``

That will start up the sample app for you which you can find at [http://localhost:3000]

###What's left to do in the project?

All sorts of stuff! First of all the front end app is really not brilliant I just chucked it together in an hour or two. and
there's no back end at all yet! Oh also there's no tests in the app :P 

As far as the project itself, we'll there's no direction at all really. There's a
basic idea but no idea for features or how to implement things or anything. I purposely left it at that in the nature of
the nature of the game we can work that out as we go.
